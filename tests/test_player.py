"""
Unit tests for the `Player` class.

This module tests the functionality of the `Player` class, including skills, skill checks, experience, and the singleton pattern.

Tests:
    - Singleton pattern for `Player` instance.
    - Retrieval and setting of player skills.
    - Skill check functionality using random values.
    - Experience point increment.
    - Colision with other sprites and with itself.
