## Beginning
Right after you distribute 8 points for your [stats](Skills.md) and right before you wake up in [room 101](newsun_hotel.md), you enter a conversation with yourself.

## Room 101
You then are awaken by a loud banging on your door and the sound of someone running away from your door.

You find yourself in a relatively empty room with a door, a clock, near the door, a poster on the wall. There’s also a bathroom with a mirror and a sink.

After you make your way through the room and find yourself opening the door, there’s no one.

## Corridor
By the corridor, you can enter conversations with two characters: 
- [Höst, The Uneasy Student](npc_host.md)
- [Tabastan, The Mindful Truant](npc_tabastan.md)
As well as enter interactions with the Elevator, which won’t work at Floor 1, the Stairs to the Second Floor, in which you are not athletic enough to make your way to, and the Stairs to Floor 0.

You climb down the stairs to find yourself at the reception of [Newsun Hotel](newsun_hotel.md).

## Floor 0
Floor 0 is where you’ll spend most of your time; it’s usually more crowded, but there are still quite a lot of things to do.

TODO: finish the rest

## Elevator
After you enter the elevator, there’s no going back. Your deeds were done and what you haven’t yet accomplished cannot be.

A loud bang is heard when the door is closed. It fell to Floor -1.

## Floor -1

The game **will** end here.

Floor -1 not only feels but acts like a different dimension.

There you meet [Han](han.md). The game ends by the end of your conversation.

Possibility: Different endings depending on your conversations/interactions/checks.
