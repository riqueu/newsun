The genderless protagonist wakes up in a room, with no prior knowledge of who they are or how they ended up in such place. Their objective is to find their way through the hotel, fix the elevator, and uncover the misteries beneath [Newsun](Newsun_Hotel.md).

The Protagonist has [Skills](Skills.md), who will guide them through their journey. They also carry a [Journal](Journal.md) in which they’ll be able to check their items.

It is later discovered that the Protagonist made a pact with an [Matilda](Matilda.md), an eldritch cockroach-like beast that lives in Floor -1. The Protagonist made a deal with it without knowing its implications. They exchanged their memory for the completion of a perfect score on a Programming Languages course’s Final Project he had forgot about and only remembered it a day before the deadline.
