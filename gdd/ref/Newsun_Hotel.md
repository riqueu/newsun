# Overview
Newsun, the place in which the story is set, is a common 5-story hotel where students from [Polaris University](Polaris_University.md) live in. It lies in the heart of [Moya](Moya.md), a neighborhood in [Förgätmigej](Förgätmigej.md).

Newsun has an eerie atmosphere, things just feel off: the inconsistent elevators, the weird clocks all over the place, the slow downward spiral into insanity students are seemingly going trough, everything feels wrong; abnormal.
