## Player Experience

The [[Story]] starts with the player waking up clueless in room 501 with one single objective: get a grip on what the hell is going on! Who they are? Where the fuck they are? Why is everyone crazy? As you connect with the guests, you start to uncover the mysteries that lie within Newsun.

[[Time]] is a precious gift, make sure you use it wisely. You must investigate the objects and interact with guests who might or might not know you. Each interaction costs time.

[[Skills]] are ones who guide you along your path. They shall help you where you need the most.

By the end of the day you shall reach the Floor -1, where you will find answers for some of the mysteries of [[Newsun Hotel]].
