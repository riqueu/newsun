## Player Experience

The [Story](ref/Story.md) starts with the player waking up clueless in room 101 with one single objective: get a grip on what the hell is going on! Who they are? Where the fuck they are? Why is everyone crazy? As you connect with the guests, you start to uncover the mysteries that lie within Newsun.

[Time](ref/Time.md) is a precious gift, make sure you use it wisely. You must investigate the objects and interact with guests who might or might not know you. Each interaction costs time.

[Skills](ref/Skills.md) are ones who guide you along your path. They shall help you where you need the most.

By the end of the day you shall reach the Floor -1, where you will find answers for some of the mysteries of [Newsun Hotel](ref/Newsun_Hotel.md).

# Concept
## Gameplay Overview

The main component of the gameplay are [interactions](ref/Interaction.md). Through passed [checks](ref/Checks.md) during interactions, you can gather experience, however, failed [checks](ref/Checks.md) might damage your [health](ref/Health.md) or your [reason](ref/Reason.md). The points distribuited to your [skills](ref/Skills.md) might give you an advantage on your [rolls/skill checks](ref/Checks.md).

You must also collect specific items through the [hotel](ref/Newsun_Hotel.md) to fix the elevator and get to Floor -1, where you trigger one of the endings. If you fail to fix the elevator before midnight, [Han](ref/Han.md) consumes the hotel and you lose the game. If you fix the elevator, [Han](ref/Han.md) might or might not enlight you with your lost memories. Your experience will be of help on that final skill check, the more experience you have, the higher your odds are.
