"""
Module containing the main game scenes in the hotel setting, such as rooms, floors, and the underground.

This module defines several scene classes (`Scene`, `Room101`, `Floor1`, `Floor0`, `Underground`) that represent different environments the player can interact with. Each scene is responsible for handling its own interactions, drawing itself, and managing dialogue or transitions between scenes.

Classes:
- `Scene`: Base class for a hotel scene, handling common functionality like event handling, dialogue management, and drawing.
- `Room101`: Represents the first room in the hotel, where the player starts.
- `Floor1`: Represents the first floor of the hotel, where the player can explore.
- `Floor0`: Represents the lobby or ground floor of the hotel.
- `Underground`: Represents the underground area, typically used for the final scenes or transitions.
